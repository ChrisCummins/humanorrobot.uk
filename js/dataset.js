A word with you, coz; marry, this, coz: there is, as 'twere a tender, a kind of tender, made afar off by Sir Hugh here: do you understand me?",

This peace is nothing but to rust iron, increase tailors, and breed ballad-makers.<br/><br/>Let me have war, say I; it exceeds peace as far as day does night; it's spritely, waking, audible, and full of vent. Peace is a very apoplexy, lethargy; mulled, deaf, sleepy, insensible; a getter of more bastard children than war's a destroyer of men.",
        "You see this chase is hotly follow'd, friends.<br/><br/>Turn head, and stop pursuit; for coward dogs<br/>Most spend their mouths when what they seem to threaten<br/>Runs far before them. Good my sovereign,<br/>Take up the English short, and let them know<br/>Of what a monarchy you are the head:<br/>Self-love, my liege, is not so vile a sin<br/>As self-neglecting.<br/>",

Let this Barnardine be this morning executed, and his head borne to Angelo.<br/><br/>Angelo hath seen them both, and will discover the favour.<br/><br/>O! death's a great disguiser, and you may add to it. Shave the head, and tie the beard; and say it was the desire of the penitent to be so bared before his death: you know the course is common.

        "There she appeared indeed, or my reporter devised well for her.<br/><br/>I will tell you.<br/>The barge she sat in, like a burnish'd throne,<br/>Burn'd on the water; the poop was beaten gold,<br/>Purple the sails, and so perfumed, that<br/>The winds were love-sick with them, the oars were silver,<br/>Which to the tune of flutes kept stroke, and made<br/>The water which they beat to follow faster,",
        "Of that we hold an idol more than he?<br/>No, this thrice-worthy and right valiant lord<br/>Must not so stale his palm, nobly acquir'd;<br/>Nor, by my will, assubjugate his merit,<br/>As amply titled as Achilles is,<br/>By going to Achilles:<br/>That were to enlard his fat-already pride,<br/>And add more coals to Cancer when he burns<br/>With entertaining great Hyperion.<br/>This lord go to him! Jupiter forbid,",

If this news be true,<br/>Poor queen and son, your labour is but lost;<br/>For Warwick is a subtle orator,<br/>And Lewis a prince soon won with moving words.<br/>By this account then Margaret may win him,<br/>For she's a woman to be pitied much:<br/>Her sighs will make a battery in his breast;<br/>Her tears will pierce into a marble heart;<br/>The tiger will be mild whiles she doth mourn;",
        "Go with me to my chamber, and advise me.<br/>I'll send her straight away: to-morrow<br/>I'll to the wars, she to her single sorrow.<br/><br/>Why, these balls bound; there's noise in it. 'Tis hard:<br/>A young man married is a man that's marr'd:<br/>Therefore away, and leave her bravely; go:<br/>The king has done you wrong: but, hush! 'tis so.<br/>",
        "Come, will you hence?<br/><br/>First, my fear; then, my curtsy; last my speech. My fear is, your displeasure, my curtsy, my duty, and my speech, to beg your pardon. If you look for a good speech now, you undo me; for what I have to say is of mine own making; and what indeed I should say will, I doubt, prove mine own marring. But to the purpose, and so to the venture. Be it known to you,as it is very well,I was lately here in the end of a displeasing play, to pray your patience for it and to promise you a better. I did mean indeed to pay you with this; which, if like an ill venture it come unluckily home, I break, and you, my gentle creditors, lose. Here, I promised you I would be, and here I commit my body to your mercies: bate me some and I will pay you some; and, as most debtors do, promise you infinitely."
