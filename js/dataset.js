But masters, here are your parts; and I am to entreat you, request you, and desire you, to con them by to-morrow night, and meet me in the palace wood, a mile without the town, by moonlight: there will we rehearse; for if we meet in the city, we shall be dogged with company, and our devices known. In the meantime I will draw a bill of properties, such as our play wants. I pray you, fail me not.<br/><br/>We will meet; and there we may rehearse more obscenely and courageously.

I am boy to them all three, but all they three, though they would serve me, could not be man to me; for, indeed three such antiques do not amount to a man. For Bardolph, he is white-livered and red-faced; by the means whereof, a' faces it out, but fights not. For Pistol, he hath a killing tongue and a quiet sword; by the means whereof a' breaks words, and keeps whole weapons. For Nym, he hath heard that men of few words are the best men; and therefore he scorns to say his prayers, lest a' should be thought a coward: but his few bad words are matched with as few good deeds; for a' never broke any man's head but his own, and that was against a post when he was drunk. They will steal any thing and call it purchase. Bardolph stole a lute-case, bore it twelve leagues, and sold it for three half-pence. Nym and Bardolph are sworn brothers in filching, and in Calais they stole a fire-shovel;I knew by that piece of service the men would carry coals,they would have me as familiar with men's pockets as their gloves or their handkerchers: which makes much against my manhood if I should take from another's pocket to put into mine; for it is plain pocketing up of wrongs. I must leave them and seek some better service: their villany goes against my weak stomach, and therefore I must cast it up.<br/>",
        "As these poor pickaxes can dig; and when<br/>With wild wood-leaves and weeds I ha' strew'd his grave,<br/>And on it said a century of prayers,<br/>Such as I can, twice o'er, I'll weep and sigh;<br/>And, leaving so his service, follow you,<br/>So please you entertain me.<br/>Ay, good youth,<br/>And rather father thee than master thee.<br/>My friends,",

Thither Macduff<br/>Is gone to pray the holy king, upon his aid<br/>To wake Northumberland and war-like Siward:",
        "At Tewksbury: despair, therefore, and die!<br/>Be cheerful, Richmond; for the wronged souls<br/>Of butcher'd princes fight in thy behalf:<br/>King Henry's issue, Richmond, comforts thee.<br/>When I was mortal, my anointed body<br/>By thee was punched full of deadly holes:<br/>Think on the Tower and me; despair and die!<br/>Henry the Sixth bids thee despair and die.<br/>",

        "This by Calphurnia's dream is signified.<br/>And this way have you well expounded it.<br/><br/>I have, when you have heard what I can say:<br/>And know it now: the senate have concluded<br/>To give this day a crown to mighty C sar.<br/>If you shall send them word you will not come,<br/>Their minds may change. Besides, it were a mock<br/>Apt to be render'd, for some one to say",
        "My master's mind.<br/>Unfold it.<br/><br/>Thus says my king: Say thou to Harry of England: Though we seemed dead, we did but sleep: advantage is a better soldier than rashness. Tell him, we could have rebuked him at Harfleur, but that we thought not good to bruise an injury till it were full ripe: now we speak upon our cue, and our voice is imperial: England shall repent his folly, see his weakness, and admire our sufferance. Bid him therefore consider of his ransom; which must proportion the losses we have borne, the subjects we have lost, the disgrace we have digested; which, in weight to re-answer, his pettiness would bow under. For our losses, his exchequer is too poor; for the effusion of our blood, the muster of his kingdom too faint a number; and for our disgrace, his own person, kneeling at our feet, but a weak and worthless satisfaction. To this add defiance: and tell him, for conclusion, he hath betrayed his followers, whose condemnation is pronounced. So far my king and master, so much my office.<br/><br/>What is thy name? I know thy quality.<br/><br/>Montjoy.<br/>",

        "I know him to be valiant.<br/>I was told that by one that knows him better than you.<br/><br/>What's he?<br/><br/>Marry, he told me so himself; and he said he cared not who knew it.<br/><br/>He needs not; it is no hidden virtue in him.",
        "I turn the trouble of my countenance<br/>Merely upon myself. Vexed I am<br/>Of late with passions of some difference,<br/>Conceptions only proper to myself,<br/>Which give some soil perhaps to my behaviours;<br/>But let not therefore my good friends be griev'd,<br/>Among which number, Cassius, be you one,<br/>Nor construe any further my neglect,<br/>Than that poor Brutus, with himself at war,<br/>Forgets the shows of love to other men.",

        "No sweet aspersion shall the heavens let fall<br/>To make this contract grow; but barren hate,<br/>Sour-ey'd disdain and discord shall bestrew<br/>The union of your bed with weeds so loathly<br/>That you shall hate it both: therefore take heed,<br/>As Hymen's lamps shall light you.<br/>As I hope<br/>For quiet days, fair issue and long life,<br/>With such love as 'tis now, the murkiest den,",

        "Drest in a little brief authority,<br/>Most ignorant of what he's most assur'd,<br/>His glassy essence, like an angry ape,<br/>Plays such fantastic tricks before high heaven<br/>As make the angels weep; who, with our spleens,<br/>Would all themselves laugh mortal.<br/>O, to him, to him, wench!

She told me, not thinking I had been myself, that I was the prince's jester; that I was duller than a great thaw; huddling jest upon jest with such impossible conveyance upon me, that I stood like a man at a mark, with a whole army shooting at me. She speaks poniards, and every word stabs: if her breath were as terrible as her terminations, there were no living near her; she would infect to the north star. I would not marry her, though she were endowed with all that Adam had left him before he transgressed: she would have made Hercules have turned spit, yea, and have cleft his club to make the fire too. Come, talk not of her; you shall find her the infernal Ate in good apparel. I would to God some scholar would conjure her, for certainly, while she is here, a man may live as quiet in hell as in a sanctuary; and people sin upon purpose because they would go thither; so, indeed, all disquiet, horror and perturbation follow her.<br/><br/>Look! here she comes.<br/>",
